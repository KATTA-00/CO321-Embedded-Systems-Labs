XTAL = 16MHz → Txtal _clock = 1/16 μs

Let's choose the biggest Prescalar that we can have. 
Then it will give highest countable time interval


Prescaler = 1:1024 → Tcounter_clock = 1024 × (1/16)μs
                                    = 64 μs

Assume maximum delay need is x μs

Maximum Counter increments in Timer0    = 256 (8 bit counter)
                                        = x μs/64 μs

Then, maximum delay (x μs)      = 256 * 64 μs
                                = 16384 μs
                                = 16.384 ms

Highest possible countable time interval using TIMER0, is 16.364 ms
Selected Prescaler is 1024.
